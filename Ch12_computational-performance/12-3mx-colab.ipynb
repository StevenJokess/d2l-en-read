For example, the `dot` operator will use all cores (and threads) on all CPUs, even if there are multiple CPU processors on a single machine. The same applies to a single GPU. Hence parallelization is not quite so useful single-device computers. With multiple devices things matter more. While parallelization is typically most relevant between multiple GPUs, adding the local CPU will increase performance slightly. See e.g., :cite:`Hadjis.Zhang.Mitliagkas.ea.2016` for a paper that focuses on training computer vision models combining a GPU and a CPU. With the convenience of an automatically parallelizing framework we can accomplish the same goal in a few lines of Python code. More broadly, our discussion of automatic parallel computation focuses on parallel computation using both CPUs and GPUs, as well as the parallelization of computation and communication.\n",

Note that this task is different from parallel computation as it uses a different resource: the bus between CPU and GPUs. In fact, we could compute on both devices and communicate, all at the same time. As noted above, there is a dependency between computation and communication: `y[i]` must be computed before it can be copied to the CPU. Fortunately, the system can copy `y[i-1]` while computing `y[i]` to reduce the total running time.\n",
