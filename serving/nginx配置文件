# You should look at the following URL's in order to grasp a solid understanding
# of Nginx configuration files in order to fully unleash the power of Nginx.
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Pitfalls
# http://wiki.nginx.org/QuickStart
# http://wiki.nginx.org/Configuration
#
# Generally, you will want to move this file somewhere, and start with a clean
# file but keep this around for reference. Or just disable in sites-enabled.
#
# Please see /usr/share/doc/nginx-doc/examples/ for more detailed examples.

# Default server configuration
#
server {
	listen 80; # nginx监听的端口
	server_name 114.55.37.249; #云主机的公网IP地址;
	client_max_body_size 10M; #修改上传文件大小
	root /var/www/face;

	#动态请求
	location / {
	include uwsgi_params;
	uwsgi_pass 127.0.0.1:8001;
	}

	#不使用UWSGI时直接请求静态页面，后期若是想用可以给静态一个专门的目录
	#location / {
	#	try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
	#}
	# SSL configuration
	#
	# listen 443 ssl default_server;
	# listen [::]:443 ssl default_server;
	#
	# Note: You should disable gzip for SSL traffic.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/773332
	#
	# Read up on ssl_ciphers to ensure a secure configuration.
	# See: https://bugs.debian.org/765782

	# Add index.php to the list if you are using PHP

	# pass the PHP scripts to FastCGI server listening on 127.0.0.1:9000
	#
	#location ~ \.php$ {

	#	# With php7.0-cgi alone:

	# concurs with nginx's one

	#location ~ /\.ht {

# You can move that to a different file under sites-available/ and symlink that
