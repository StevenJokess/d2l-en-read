Hi all.
This is self-paced course for me to understand more about the ML.
If it is NOT allowed to add comments/questions except for the officially registered students, I will not write anything here further.

@StevenJokes
3. stride each 2*sampling rate
You mean down sampling by 2?

4. Cannot understand the question clearly.
Just saying that it can reduce the calculation of hidden layer seems to be too simple & obvious answer. Expecting other answers?

I guess it is. I’m not sure about it.

You are almost right! Strides help remove unnecessary computational burdensome and help to reduce the feature dimension more quickly.
