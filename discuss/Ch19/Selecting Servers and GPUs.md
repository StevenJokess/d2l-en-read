FrameView Performance and Power Benchmarking App

Graphics cards are investments, bought on the promise of delivering excellent performance in that card’s class for at least 2 to 3 years. It’s therefore important that the benchmarks of these cards, which you’re likely using as research, are accurate and cover all the bases, showing frame rates, frame times, power usage, performance per watt, and more.
