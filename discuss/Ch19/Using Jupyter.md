install jupyter notebook by conda install notebook

Measure A⊤BA⊤B vs. ABAB for two square matrices in R1024×1024R1024×1024. Which one is faster?

I think it depends on data? Do we use SVD or sparse matrix when multiplying?

Hinter:

We can use the Hinterland plugin to give a hint without using tab while coding. Use the following commands to install the plugin:

# https://github.com/Jupyter-contrib/jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
pip install jupyter_nbextensions_configurator
jupyter nbextensions_configurator enable --user
And we need to check.
