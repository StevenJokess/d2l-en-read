Hello,

Maybe my question seems silly. I never used MXNET before and I prefer Tensorflow, but I can’t open some implementation in Tensorflow. In the explorer, it shows .ipynb file size is 0KB and in the jupyter notebook, shows error “Unreadable Notebook: D:\Python scripts\d2l-en\tensorflow\chapter_generative-adversarial-networks\dcgan.ipynb NotJSONError(“Notebook does not appear to be JSON: ‘’…”)”. Help me. Btw, mxnet implementation works okay.

You can check the chapter DCGAN, then you will find that there isn’t tensorflow code now.
:sweat_smile:

You can join us to translate from mxnet to tensorflow.
I’m translating DCGAN from mxnet to pytorch, but still stuck.

Unfortunately I am new to MXNET, I afraid I can’t.

Thanks for response.

:rofl:
I’m new to pytorch and mxnet too.
Then I have translated GAN from pytorch and mxnet.

If you follow the book step by step, I think it won’t be hard for you.

And I found Chapter 17. Representation Learning and Generative Learning Using Autoencoders and GANs: https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/ch17.html#idm45728442616808

Maybe it will help you if you are a member of Oreilly or ACM.

Hi, I am new to this. I have just installed miniconda on Widdows. How to perform the next step?

Download the corresponding Miniconda sh file from the website and then execute the installation from the command line using sh <FILENAME> -b .
Download the D2L notebook?
