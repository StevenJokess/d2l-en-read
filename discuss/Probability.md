batch size = 1, stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
batch size = 256, mini-batch gradient descent (MBGD)
Because using GPU to parallel read data, so MBGD is quicker.
Reducing the batch_size will make overall read performance slower.
:face_with_monocle:Does my guess right?
Iâ€™m a Windows user. Try it next time!
