I'm a newbie. I'm learning d2l DCGAN.
And I try to translate to pytorch. Then I found it isn't same with tutorial in pytorch.org.
Which one is right?
My issue is here: Maybe our DCGAN have extra nn.BatchNorm2d(ndf)?
Still not finish my work: PR

BTW, I found .add in mxnet is easy to use than .add_module in pytorch, which must name a new layer.
But I have another problem: After we added a layer, it will exist next time?
If then, how to delete or change a layer? Or, more often we just create a new structure?

And one more thing, the new d2l forum have no offical reply three days.
I'm a newbie. I'm trying to answer some, but I'm afraid to mislead others.
Please spare some time to answer some if you guys can.

I'm thinking that the forum is most important to get more new users and find pain spots when communicating.
The pytorch's friendly is caused by the saved discussions. But if we use our forum correctly, we will beat them.

Our discussion is just after the chapters' context. It will be more systemic.
And we should rule the dicussions to depulicate less.

My opinion here:

We must let others to know that you cared about them when using our framework.
And the efforts about code can be delayed a little, because we need to train the first wave users from tf and pytorch to let them get familiar to mxnet. Then they can train the next and next waves.
I think one reason why mxnet 1.0 failed is that we don't care others and give no reply to their questions in discuss.mxnet.io .

We need to discuss more mxnet details other than just throw a universal code or docs.

The old developers must spare your precious time to test all mxnet code and fix them ASAP.
The old developers must spare your precious time to answer questions ASAP when we adding pytorch and tensorflow context, to attract other tf and pytorch users to coming.
And we should give them reasons why our framework is good after finishing replying.

d2l is the our only book, and we can find at least 5 books of pytorch and tensorflow.
If we don't grasp this chance, d2l will just help pytorch and tf developing and make mxnet more deadly.

All my thoughts.

Don't joke.
Please look https://discuss.mxnet.io/ again.
I ask you how many questions replied here these two months.
Then you can contrast it with discuss.pytorch.org

If we don't have many users, we should pay more attention to them and try to answer every questions.
Then more new users will come, because they know they can find others' solutions and if they can't, they are still cared about to be answered.

Just imagine you are new user now. Which framework you will learn and which forum you will ask?

Why astonZhang and mli never answer questions in d2lbook?
Are they afraid that the answer will destroy our unsupervised learning?

@StevenJokes thanks for the feedback and I'm really glad that you feel strongly about mxnet and want it to get better. I share the sentiment and as a community I think this is indeed an area where we try to improve. cc @astonzhang on the d2l support. cc @sandeep-krishnamurthy

That said, the past few comments have been off-topic, and I will mark them so once others have a chance to look at them.

Off-topic again...
I hate yours' saying. The most important reason that I'm here is just to talk to all your developers.

---

You should know that not all users have time and knowledge to read rules and follow your d2l systemic book.
Make your rules simple and obvious next time.
