# Wasserstein GAN (WGAN)

WGAN, which uses a modified loss function based on the so-called Wasserstein-1 (or earth mover's) distance between the distributions of real and fake images for improving the training performance.[1]


we talked about the WGAN with GP to maintain the 1-Lipschitz property instead of clipping the weights.[1]
