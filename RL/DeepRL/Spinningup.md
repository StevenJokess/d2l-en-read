# Welcome to Spinning Up in Deep RL!

This is an educational resource produced by OpenAI that makes it easier to learn about deep reinforcement learning (deep RL).

For the unfamiliar: reinforcement learning (RL) is a machine learning approach for teaching agents how to solve tasks by trial and error. Deep RL refers to the combination of RL with deep learning.

This module contains a variety of helpful resources, including:

- a short introduction to RL terminology, kinds of algorithms, and basic theory,
- an essay about how to grow into an RL research role,
- a curated list of important papers organized by topic,
- a well-documented code repo of short, standalone implementations of key algorithms,
and a few exercises to serve as warm-ups.
