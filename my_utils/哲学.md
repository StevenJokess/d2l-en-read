一个团队的定海神针，就是能把问题转化成目标函数的那个人——哪怕他连开源工具都不会用。100 万找到这样的人，可真是捡了个大便宜。

业务逼着你跑，你不跑不行，可能跑着就累死了；你停下来歇会儿，搞搞技术改造，又可能被业务压力压死了，反正都是死 。

对于大拧巴，除了少挖坑，多填坑，更需要机遇：

抱紧大需求
暴露大问题

We're also not willing to go down the rabbit hole of providing endless, open ended and personalized support on this open source project.  Our position is this:  If you have the proper background and resources, the project provides more than enough to get you started.

In contrast, if you're asking about something that really amounts to asking for personalized and time consuming support that won't benefit anybody else, we're not going to help. It's simply not in our interest to do that. We have bills to pay, after all. And if you're asking for help on something that can already be derived from the documentation or code?  That's simply annoying, and we're not going to pretend to be ok with that.
