## Weights & Biases Logging ðŸŒŸ NEW

Weights & Biases (W&B) is now integrated with YOLOv5 for real-time visualization and cloud logging of training runs. This allows for better run comparison and introspection, as well improved visibility and collaboration for teams. To enable W&B pip install wandb, and then train normally (you will be guided through setup on first use).

During training you will see live updates at https://wandb.ai/home, and you can create and share detailed Reports of your results. For more information see the YOLOv5 Weights & Biases Tutorial.
